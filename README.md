Repository Overview

Welcome to our Disney Movie Analysis repository! This project assists in scraping movie data from movie rating websites, specifically IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, and making it into a clean and usable dataframe. This information is then used to analyze the factors that influence movie scores, view trends over time, and compare ratings between IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. To view our application of this to Disney movies, view the analysis.ipynb file in the project folder.
