-- : Things I am doing (I'll do others as well though)
* : Notes for you
Anything else we can either both work on or see who has time to finish, but they need to be done.

Paper:
Abstract
Statistical Methods
Results Overview
* Results on Book data (Probably run with IMDB since it has more information and is the main one I've been analyzing?)
--Finish results factors section and director and actors section
Conclusion

Package:
Add any last functionality
test.py file
Finish and combine analysis notebooks
--Ask Dr. Rhodes about separate demo.ipynb
* clean_data.py - I have moved our functions to clean_data_functions.py, clean_data, at Dr. Rhodes request, should take the raw data from our data folder and run everything necessary 
                  to clean it and create the cleaned csv files. If you could get this working with your book data that would be great.

Last Steps: 
--Update github pages one last time
Double check requirements.txt
Double check __init__.py
Download package in fresh environment and make sure everything works, run clean_data.py
Delete ToDo


* I did a super basic hypothesis test and confidence interval using statmodels, so we can just leave it at that, or feel free to add functions.
